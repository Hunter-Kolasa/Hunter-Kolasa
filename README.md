- ðŸ‘€  Iâ€™m interested in helping everywhere I can! Comfortable with Ruby, Rails, JS, React, Redux, HTML5 and CSS but always striving to learn more
- ðŸŒ±   Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of writing clean, clear, concise, DRY code that can be separated into reusable blocks for use in multiple projects
