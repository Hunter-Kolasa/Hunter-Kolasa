- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hunter-Kolasa
- Working on: 
  - Streamlining my JobHunter application, connecting additional API's and implementing JWT Auth 
  - Updating my Exoplanets CLI to NASA's TAP formatting
  - Building a Podcaster application to keep track of all of those juicy software development podcasts!
- 👀  I’m interested in helping everywhere I can! Comfortable with Ruby, Rails, JS, React, Redux, HTML5 and CSS but always striving to learn more
- 🌱   I’m currently learning the ins and outs of writing clean, clear, concise, DRY code that can be separated into reusable blocks for use in multiple projects
