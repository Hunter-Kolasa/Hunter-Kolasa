- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hunter-Kolasa
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things full-stack including but nowhere near limited to Ruby, Rails, JS, React, Redux, HTML5 and CSS
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of writing clean, clear, concise, DRY code that can be separated into reusable blocks for use in multiple projects!
