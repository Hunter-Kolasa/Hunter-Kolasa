- ⌛  Working on: 
     -Streamlining my JobHunter application, connecting additional API's and implementing JWT Auth 
     -Updating my Exoplanets CLI to NASA's TAP formatting
- 👀  I’m interested in helping everywhere I can! Comfortable with Ruby, Rails, JS, React, Redux, HTML5 and CSS but always striving to learn more
